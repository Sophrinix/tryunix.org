tryunix.org - Try Unix (in a browser)
=====================================

.. Note:: This is a tribute to the over-eagerness,
   confidence, eerie clarity of mind provided by the early
   onset of ADHD Meds. I wish I was joking. Combine this
   with hyperfocus and you get a night well spent writing
   code you can't even wrap your head around the next day.

About
-----

This is a rather sad attempt at recreating something like
tryruby.org_, tryerlang.org_, tryhaskell.org_ and the likes.

It is meant to be every so slightly tongue in cheek, as Unix,
while all about the dirty little tools glued together with duct tape,
does not exactly fit itself in the lovely, simple, pure, minimalistic
philosophy of agile development and Web 2.0, at least *not that directly*.

I thought something completely stupid like:

  "Hey! I love Unix and enjoy sharing my passion for it as well as the knowledge 
  and tidbits I have gathered over the years, hacking at my shell! 
  I also know some Python! I do web servers for a living, hey, I can do websites.
  And I know for a *fact* that jquery-console_ exists and could do this stuff!
  I'm not very good at JavaScript, but it must not be **that** hard, no? 
  And I basically know how RESTful web services work, and could probably get 
  away with writing a simple backend to such a console that could emulate a 
  basic Unix system! **How hard could it be? I could totally do this!**"

And then, the next day the Adderall wore off and I found myself biting my lower lip, looking at the receipt for the purchase of the tryunix.org_ domain, and the very scarce documentation_ for WebCore_ (however the code_ is very, very readable, so that's not insurmountable). Still, I sat there with a single sentence resonating through my thoughts, as read by some aggravated deity's booming voice:

*"OH GOD WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?"*

Hopefully one day, this code will be functional and I can say I'm the creative mastermind behind the piece of crud that is tryunix.org_.

Requirements
-------------

So far not only is project not even close to functional, but I am pedant enough to list
the requirements as they come.

System:
~~~~~~~~
* Python 2.5+
* virtualenv_ is strongly recommended
* distribute/setuptools (should be pretty standard)
* A decent web server supporting WSGI

              -- OR --

* gunicorn_ behind something like nginx_.

Python Modules:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
.. Note:: Apart from WebCore (to be safe) there is absolutely
          no need to install these separately if you are going
          to use ``setup.py`` (most likely), as it will pull
          the required deps for you. I'm merely listing them
          for clarity's sake.

* WebCore_ - Web Framework. Awesome.
* Genshi_ - Templating Engine
* Beaker_ - Session and Caching library (WSGI Middleware)

Very Hastily Writtenâ„¢ Hacker's Guide to Poking at the Source
-------------------------------------------------------------

1. ``$ mkdir ~/.python-envs/``
2. ``$ virtualenv --distribute --no-site-packages ~/.python-envs/tryunix``
3. ``$ source ~/.python-envs/tryunix/bin/activate``
4. ``(tryunix)$ pip install WebCore``
5. ``(tryunix)$ git clone https://github.com/mrdaemon/tryunix.org.git``
6. ``(tryunix)$ cd tryunix.org && python setup.py develop``

You're set. ``setup.py`` will fetch and install dependencies for you. 
Run `paster serve --reload dev.ini` to launch the app,
the point your browser at http://127.0.0.1:8888/

It should work. At some point. Eventually. But you'll probably staring at broken code
and the nastiest tracebacks known to man.
